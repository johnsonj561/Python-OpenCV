Image path argument required
python main.py -i "comp1_2x.jpg"

Optional Arguments Include:
"-i", "--image", help = "path to the image file being processed")
"-lt", "--low", help = "low threshold value used for creating binary image", type=int, default=0)
"-ht", "--high", help = "high threshold value used for creating binary image", type=int, default=40)
"-ma", "--minarea", help = "minimum pixel area to detect during contour detection, smaller objects contours will be ignored", type=int, default=250)

-lt and -ht are used to create binary black/white image
Thresholding description taken from http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d4d/tutorial_py_thresholding.html#gsc.tab=0
cv2.threshold(img,127,255,cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
Here, the matter is straight forward. If pixel value is greater than a threshold value, it is assigned one value (may be white), else it is assigned 
another value (may be black). The function used is cv2.threshold. First argument is the source image, which should be a grayscale image. Second argument 
is the threshold value which is used to classify the pixel values. Third argument is the maxVal which represents the value to be given if pixel value 
is more than (sometimes less than) the threshold value. OpenCV provides different styles of thresholding and it is decided by the fourth parameter of 
the function. 

-ma is the minimum pixel area that can be considered a solution to component tracker problem
Any countour areas detected that are smaller than the minarea will be ignored
This allows program to ignore small contours generated by noise

If component is detected, it's position (x,y) dimensions (w,h) and it's angle of rotation are applied to the image as feedback
Binary image and output image with component details are displayed to user
's' key will save output image, all other keys will terminate program
